TODO

Short-term

  * redesign `differentiate` to be a manipulation itself
  * design tests for number simplification and differentiation

Long-term

  * find more examples, preferably with novel `scoring` functions
  * redesign `numbers` transform rules (make more complete/minimal/efficient)

Completed

  * boolean algebra simplification
  * symbolic differentiation
